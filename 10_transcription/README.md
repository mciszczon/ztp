# Transcription algorithm from Russian cyryllic to Polish latin

The aim of this algorith is to be as precise as possible, as there's currently no good apps for thatâ€”they miss on some details.
The implementation will be as flexible as possible in order to allow adding more langauges and options in future.

## Testing
Just enter the root folder of the app and run `pytest`. Ensure you have all the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` first.

## Contents
- `/rules` contains rules on how to transcribe various languages
- `/utils` contains all the classes and functions that operate on input data and rules
- `/tests` contains tests for all the app
